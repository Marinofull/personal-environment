The script `append-bash` does all the magic. It just sources any `bash-*` file here to the `.bash_profile`.

So, if you want any new bash functions, alias, what else... Just write it in a file with *bash-* as a prefix.


What cool tricks are here?
 - `duckit`: a function to duck something in terminal;
 - `vimspell`: start vim in `spelllang` mode. Thanks to [niltonvasques](https://github.com/Marinofull/dotfiles/tree/master/.vim/spell);
 - `extract`: a cool function to extract almost every freaking compact file format. Thanks to [orrsella](https://github.com/orrsella/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/functions);
 - and more!
